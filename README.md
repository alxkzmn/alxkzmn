## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex, blockchain and ZK engineer

I'm a full-stack blockchain developer learning about Zero-Knowledge Proofs. I got an MSc in Electronic Engineering in 2008. After that, I did some academic research in applied maths while teaching low-level programming and digital signal processing. I started my engineering career in 2011 as an embedded systems engineer and then switched to mobile development (Android and later cross-platform in Flutter). In 2021 I switched to full-stack blockchain development and began learning about zero-knowledge proofs, which has recently become my primary professional interest. Aside from engineering, I enjoy making music and learning foreign languages.

### Learning & Hacking

* Harmony ZK University [study group](https://zku.one/), 2022 - pushed my competencies in applied ZKP to a new level. Things I learned: 
    * Groth16 vs PLONK; 
    * Cryptographic commitments & nullifiers;
    * Merkle trees.
* ETHGlobal Road to Web3 Hackathon, 2022 - [Fluidium](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/roadtoweb3/fluidium), a token streaming dApp utilizing [Superfluid protocol](https://www.superfluid.finance/). I contributed my smart contract development skills. [[source](https://github.com/Fluidum/fluidum)]

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex, ZKP and blockchain engineer

I am currently working as a ZKP circuit engineer with the Privacy and Scaling Exploration team at the Ethereum Foundation. I earned my MSc in Electronic Engineering in 2008 and subsequently delved into academic research in applied maths while teaching low-level programming and digital signal processing. My engineering career officially started in 2011 when I began working as an embedded systems engineer. I shifted to mobile development in 2014, starting with Android and moving to cross-platform development using Flutter. In 2021, I transitioned to full-stack blockchain development and began learning about zero-knowledge proofs, which has become my primary professional interest. Beyond engineering, I take pleasure in making music and learning foreign languages.
